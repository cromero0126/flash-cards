    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "True. Embedded operating systems must operate within strict hardware constraints, often with limited memory and processing power. Therefore, they are engineered to be extremely compact, resource-efficient, and reliable to ensure continuous operation without failure."

    "question": "Windows can be expensive since the OS is paid license and the majority of its applications are paid products..",
    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "True. Unlike open-source alternatives like Linux, the Windows ecosystem typically relies on a proprietary licensing model where the operating system itself and many of its popular productivity suites require purchase. This contributes to a higher total cost of ownership."

    "question": "UNIX and Linux are very similar operating systems.",
    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "True. Linux was designed as a 'Unix-like' operating system, effectively cloning the architecture, command-line structure, and philosophy of UNIX. While they are distinct entities—one being a registered trademark and the other an open-source kernel—they operate in a very similar manner."

      "power",
      "memory",
      "data"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "Embedded systems are often deployed in environments where regular maintenance is difficult or impossible. Consequently, they are designed to be robust and stable, capable of running their specific tasks reliably for their entire lifecycle without the frequent software updates typical of general-purpose computers."

      "x86",
      "ARM",
      "Dorito"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "The Windows operating system has historically been architected to run on the **x86** instruction set architecture (and its 64-bit extension, x64). While versions for other architectures exist, the vast majority of Windows software and driver ecosystems are built around Intel and AMD x86 processors."

    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "True. A key characteristic of multi-threaded programs is that each thread maintains its own program counter, allowing different parts of the code to execute independently and concurrently. This effectively creates multiple distinct points of execution within a single process."

    "question": "Which of the following is not an advantage of parallel computing?",
    "choices": [
      "Saves time and money",

      "It is harder to type."
    ],
    "correctIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Parallel computing offers technical advantages like speed (saving time), cost-efficiency through resource pooling, and optimized hardware utilization. \"It is harder to type\" is a subjective observation about code complexity, not an inherent architectural advantage or disadvantage of the computing paradigm itself."

    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "True. On a single processor, concurrency is simulated by time-slicing. To switch execution from one thread to another, the operating system must perform a **context switch**, saving the state (registers, program counter) of the current thread and loading the saved state of the next one."
  },

    "question": "Which of the following is an application of parallel computing?",
    "choices": [
      "real-time simulation systems",
      "more colors on the screen",
      "music sounds better",
      "less storage space is used"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "Real-time simulation systems (such as weather modeling or flight simulators) require massive computational power to process complex mathematical models instantly. Parallel computing allows these calculations to be divided across multiple processors to meet the strict timing constraints required for real-time performance."

    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "The **Mac** operating system (Classic Mac OS) was instrumental in popularizing the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for personal computers in 1984. It introduced concepts like windows, icons, and mouse interaction to a mass audience, moving away from command-line interfaces."

      "processes",
      "threads",
      "schedules",
      "lines"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Parallel computing heavily relies on **threads** to achieve concurrency. Threads are lightweight units of execution that share the same memory space within a process, allowing applications to perform multiple tasks simultaneously across available processor cores."

    "question": "Windows was a GUI later installed in______ OS.",
    "choices": [
      "MacOS",
      "Unix",
      "Linux",
      "MS-DOS"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Early versions of Microsoft Windows were not standalone operating systems but rather graphical operating environments that ran on top of **MS-DOS**. They relied on the underlying disk operating system for file management and system services."

    "choices": [
      "NTFS",
      "FAT32",
      "AFS",
      "MBR"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "While modern macOS uses APFS and previously used HFS+, in the context of specific older file system comparisons or networking protocols (Apple File Service), **AFS** is identified here as the file system associated with the Mac environment, distinguishing it from Windows' NTFS or FAT32."

    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "False. While threads within a process share the heap and global variables, each thread requires its **own individual stack**. This stack tracks local variables, function calls, and execution history specific to that thread's independent path of execution."
  },
  {
    "question": "In most cases, only one instruction is handled at a time in the processor.",
    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "True. In a standard sequential processing model (Von Neumann architecture), the CPU fetches, decodes, and executes instructions one by one. While techniques like pipelining overlap these stages, the fundamental execution flow processes a single instruction stream at any given discrete moment."
