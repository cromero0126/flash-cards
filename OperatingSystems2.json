    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "True. Unlike open-source alternatives like Linux, the Windows ecosystem typically relies on a proprietary licensing model where the operating system itself and many of its popular productivity suites require purchase. This contributes to a higher total cost of ownership."

      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,

    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "True. On a single processor, concurrency is simulated by time-slicing. To switch execution from one thread to another, the operating system must perform a **context switch**, saving the state (registers, program counter) of the current thread and loading the saved state of the next one."

    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "False. While threads within a process share the heap and global variables, each thread requires its **own individual stack**. This stack tracks local variables, function calls, and execution history specific to that thread's independent path of execution."

    "question": "In most cases, only one instruction is handled at a time in the processor.",
    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "True. In a standard sequential processing model (Von Neumann architecture), the CPU fetches, decodes, and executes instructions one by one. While techniques like pipelining overlap these stages, the fundamental execution flow processes a single instruction stream at any given discrete moment."

      "Ext4",
      "MacFS"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "**MacFS** is not a standard or recognized file system name. The proprietary file systems historically and currently used by Apple are HFS, HFS+, and APFS (Apple File System), while FAT32, NTFS, and Ext4 are standard file systems for Windows and Linux."

    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "True. In most operating systems (especially Unix-like ones), a storage device's file system is not accessible to the user or applications until it has been **mounted**, which attaches it to a specific location within the system's directory tree."

    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "False. **Unmounting** is critical before removing a device or shutting down because it ensures that any cached data in volatile memory (RAM) is flushed and written back to the physical disk, preventing data corruption and loss."

    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "False. **Dismounting** (or unmounting) is the exact opposite: it is the process of logically disconnecting a file system from the operating system, ensuring all pending I/O operations are complete so the device can be safely removed."

      "Metadata",
      "Data encryption",
      "Ordering"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 3,

    ],
    "correctIndex": 2,

    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "True. Without a **file system** to index and organize data (e.g., using inodes or file allocation tables), data would be a raw, unstructured stream of bits. Locating a specific file would require scanning the entire disk sequentially, which is extremely inefficient."
