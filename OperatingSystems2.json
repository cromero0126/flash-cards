    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "True. Unlike open-source alternatives like Linux, the Windows ecosystem typically relies on a proprietary licensing model where the operating system itself and many of its popular productivity suites require purchase. This contributes to a higher total cost of ownership."

    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "True. On a single processor, concurrency is simulated by time-slicing. To switch execution from one thread to another, the operating system must perform a **context switch**, saving the state (registers, program counter) of the current thread and loading the saved state of the next one."

    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],

    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "True. In a standard sequential processing model (Von Neumann architecture), the CPU fetches, decodes, and executes instructions one by one.

      "MacFS"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "**MacFS** is not a standard or recognized file system name. The proprietary file systems historically and currently used by Apple are HFS, HFS+, and APFS (Apple File System), while FAT32, NTFS, and Ext4 are standard file systems for Windows and Linux."

    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "True. In most operating systems (especially Unix-like ones), a storage device's file system is not accessible to the user or applications until it has been **mounted**, which attaches it to a specific location within the system's directory tree."

    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "False. **Unmounting** is critical before removing a device or shutting down because it ensures that any cached data in volatile memory (RAM) is flushed and written back to the physical disk, preventing data corruption and loss."

      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "False. **Dismounting** (or unmounting) is the exact opposite: it is the process of logically disconnecting a file system from the operating system, ensuring all pending I/O operations are complete so the device can be safely removed."

      "Metadata",
      "Data encryption",
      "Ordering"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 3,
