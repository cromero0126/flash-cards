    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "False. The **R-squared (R²)** statistic measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). An R² of **0.95** indicates a very strong correlation and a good fit, meaning the model explains 95% of the variance."
